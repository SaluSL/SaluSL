### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Take a look at some of my team projects:

- ### [planimbly](https://github.com/planimbly/planimbly)- an automatic shift work scheduler software 
I take part in creating a front-end of the application in vue.js + bootstrap5, CI/CD pipeline, dockerizing and deploying the app to a PaaS service and to a single machine of our client

- ### [AI Forklift](https://git.wmi.amu.edu.pl/s452625/projektAI) - a simulation of an AI assisted forklift
I took a part in creating the simulation in pygame and creating a decision tree to assist the forklift
